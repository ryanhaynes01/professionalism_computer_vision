## Installing DLIB

### Windows

Before starting this process, ensure that Python and PIP are in your machines PATH of you machine, unless you know how to use PIP without this being the case.
Installing DLIB on a Windows machine requires a lot more effort than on Mac and Linux Operating Systems.\
First, you'll need to install CMake and add it to your PATH directory via the installer. If you already have CMake installed, however,
you can add it to the PATH directory after installation.\
Moreover, **ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed onto your machine**, either via Visual Studio or GCC, etc. 
Upon doing this, you can following this link, you can use CMD to enter the following command:
```
pip install https://github.com/jloh02/dlib/releases/download/v19.22/dlib-19.22.99-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
```
After allowing this to download, you can then move onto the setup.py (WIP).

### Linux and Mac

**(WIP)**

## Setup

For easy installation of all remaining modules, make sure that the Python and PIP directories are in the PATH of your machine.
Running this will install all modules required to run this application, however, DLIB must be installed as shown above.
